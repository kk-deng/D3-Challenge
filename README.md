With the use of D3.js. this project analyzes the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creates charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings. Each circle represents individual American state.

## Summary of features

This project creates scatter plots between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare/Smokes/Obesity vs. Poverty/Age/Income`

* Place additional labels in the scatter plot and give them click events. 

* Animate the transitions for the circles' locations as well as the range of the axes. 

### Bonus

* Do this for three risk factors for each axis as the choices for users.

* Add tooltips to the circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected. 

* Use the `d3-tip.js` plugin developed by Justin Palmer
